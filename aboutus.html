            <h1 class="tittle">YOUR GO-TO CHECKLIST FOR PACKING LIKE A PRO</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="item2">
            <p class="p1">Packing can be the bane of your life: but we’ve made the chore a little less tiresome for you
                and
                devised a complete packing list. Got a big trip coming up? Use this ultimate guide to remind you of
                useful
                essentialsand if you need to buy something that you don't have yet look it up on our product bar whether
                it’s
                camaras, hoodie,pillow or sun glasses. Knowing how to pack a backpack for a long trip ain’t easy. But
                simply
                treat this as a packing checklist and tick off each item as you go. Of course, it really depends on what
                kind of
                trip you’re about to embark on whether it’s trekking a mountain, or interrailing Europe, so we’ve tried
                to
                include items that cater to every kind of trip! </p>
            <p class="p2">When it comes to packing, the best way to pack a backpack is to save space. Our top tip is to
                fold
                your clothes efficiently. Remember: Heavy stuff at the bottom, stuff that leaks goes in plastic bags and
                things
                you’ll need as soon as you arrive at your destination (like toiletries) at the top. Roll your clothes up
                rather
                than fold them if it takes up less room.</p>
            <h2 class="h2">Here is the list you need</h2>
        </div>
        <img class="checklist" src="img/list.jpg" />
        <div class="item3">
            <ul class="list">
                <li><strong>PASSAPORT</strong></li>
                <p>Could you think of anything worse than rocking up to the airport realising you forgot your passport,
                    then
                    missing your flight because you have to go home to get it!</p>
                <li><strong>UNDERWEAR</strong></li>
                <p>Always bring extra underwear you don't know what may happen in the trip!</p>
                <li><strong>SOCKS</strong></li>
                <p>We all know socks are the most easy clothes to lose we have to always bring them ,they will keep you
                    warn
                    during night.</p>
                <li><strong>CHARGER</strong></li>
                <p>The second worse thing that can happen to you is forgot your charger at home.You may be thinking I
                    can buy a
                    new one if I forgot my old one at home! And your right but just in case pack two . </p>
                <li><strong>CLOTHES(INCLUDING PJ'S)</strong></li>
                <p>Remember to take light layers and warm layers. Pack enough clothes to last the duration of your stay.
                    But
                    don't overpack - it's going to be hard to fit everything in your backpack if you take more than
                    necessary.
                    If you're going on a long trip, be sure to check the hostel has a laundry room so you can wear
                    clothes over
                    again.</p>
                <li><strong>WATERPROOF MAC</strong></li>
                <p>The weather around Europe can be unpredictable depending on which city you're going to, so be
                    prepared with
                    waterproof layers if you'll be in cities prone to rain. Check weather updates throughout your trip.
                </p>
                <li><strong>COMFORTABLES SHOES</strong></li>
                <P>It’s usually best to wear your sneakers at the airport so that you can save space in your luggage and
                    feel
                    comfortable during the trip.</P>
                <li><strong>WATER BOTTLE</strong></li>
                <p>For travelling, we recommend a metal water bottle. These are more hygienic and long lasting.</p>
                <li><strong>HAIR BRUSH</strong></li>
                <P>The essential hair products that will come in handy when getting ready for the hostel bar crawl or
                    when do
                    you get out of the shower.</P>
                <li><strong>CAMERA</strong></li>
                <p>Forget this bad boy and you'll regret it forever.Everytime you want to take a picture and capture the
                    moment
                    really well with every deatail you will definitely need a camera.And make sure you have a spare
                    memory card
                    on you if you'll need one!</p>
                <li><strong>SHAMPO & CONDITIONER</strong></li>
                <p>Small, portable bottles are better for travelling and a lot lighter than the big plastic shampoo and
                    conditioner bottles. It would be useful to fill up smaller sized bottles with your hair products if
                    you find
                    you're running out of space in your backpack.</p>
                <li><strong>GLASSES</strong></li>
                <p>glasses are always going to look really good with your outfits and they also will protect you from
                    the sun!
                </p>
                <li><strong>FIRST AID KIT</strong></li>
                <p>Every backpacker should carry a first aid kit - you never know when you'll need it. Especially if
                    you'll be
                    doing a trekking-based trip.</p>
                <li><strong>THERMAL FLASK AND CUP</strong></li>
                <p>If you're planning on camping out and cooking, remember matches/a fire starter, food and cooking
                    utensils.
                </p>
                <li><strong>SNACKS</strong></li>
                <P>Small snacks that will fit in your backpack. Breakfast bars, trail mix, sweets. These will come in
                    handy if
                    you’re going trekking/hiking. Or they can make for a quick, easy breakfast on the go.</P>
